# Simple-quantum-algorithms-with-qiskit-and-flask

Hello all I have made this app while working at QKRISH as a summer intern.

This app uses python flask, matplotlib, and qiskit to implement quantum algorithms:
1. [Quantum Teleportation](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html)
2. [Deutsch-jozsa](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/deutsch-jozsa.html)

which are shown using HTML and CSS!

Thank you!!
